In Playwright, BrowserContext and Page are essential components for managing browser automation. A BrowserContext represents an isolated browser session, similar to an incognito or private browsing window in a browser. It allows you to create multiple independent sessions within the same browser instance, each with its own cookies, storage, and settings. 
A Page, on the other hand, is a single tab or window within a BrowserContext.

It will run the test in all three Playwright-supported  browsers, i.e., Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
This line imports the test and expect functions from the Playwright Test library.
test: Used to define and run a test case.
expect: This is used to make assertions (i.e., checks or verifications).

const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('check title on Google', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Google/);
});

Run test from terminal
npx playwright test tests/test.spec.ts  (headless execution)
Run the test in a specific browser and in headed mode
npx playwright test tests/test.spec.ts --project chromium --headed   (–"project firefox”  “–project webkit”)
Using –debug flag
npx playwright test tests/test.spec.ts --project chromium --debug

Run test in UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

Capture a Screenshot as homepage file in project folder
await page.screenshot({ path: 'homepage.png' });

automatically capture screenshots on failure by adding below code in playwright.config.js:
use: {
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure', // or 'on', 'off'
}

record a video of the entire test session by adding below code in playwright.config.js:
use: {
  video: 'on' // options: 'on', 'off', 'retain-on-failure'
}

To enable tracing, use: {
  trace: 'on-first-retry' // or 'on', 'retain-on-failure'
}
