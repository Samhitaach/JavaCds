Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the application being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age, and other disadvantaged groups. It is a subset of Usability Testing.

People with disabilities use assistive technology, which helps them in operating a software product. Examples of such software are:

Speech recognition software – Converts the spoken word to text, which serves as input to the computer.
Screen reader software – Used to read out the text that is displayed on the screen.
Screen Magnification Software– Used to enlarge the monitor and make reading easy for vision-impaired users.
Special keyboard made for users for easy typing who have motor control difficulties
